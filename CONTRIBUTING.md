This guide is primarily intended to be _descriptive_, detailing the usage
that Swift developers at GitHub have arrived at in cases of disagreement.
Consider whether a proposed addition would make more sense in a fork used
by your projects/organization instead.

If you want to suggest a change or addition that will help accomplish
[the goals](README.md) of this style guide, please open a pull request that:

 1. Explains the guideline
 1. Demonstrates the guideline with more-or-less valid example code
 1. Justifies the guideline by explaining the rationale behind it

Just note that all suggestions are open to discussion and debate! :smile:
